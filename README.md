## Usage

- Simply click on the aspect ratio button of your choice. If the aspect ratio is greater than 1, the script adjusts the width while keeping the height fixed. Conversely, if the aspect ratio is less than 1, it changes the height while keeping the width fixed.
- You can reset the image resolution by clicking on one of the buttons in the second row.

### Configuration

You can define aspect ratios in the `/sd-webui-ar/aspect_ratios.txt` file. For example:

```
1:1, 1.0
3:2, 3/2
4:3, 4/3
16:9, 16/9
# 6:13, 6/13
# 9:16, 9/16
# 3:5, 3/5
# 2:3, 2/3
# 19:16, 19/16 # fox movietone
# 5:4, 5/4 # medium format photo
# 11:8, 11/8 # academy standard
# IMAX, 1.43
# 14:9, 14/9
# 16:10, 16/10
# ùúë, 1.6180 # golden ratio
# 5:3, 5/3 # super 16mm
# 1.85, 1.85 # US widescreen cinema
# DCI, 1.9 # digital imax
# 2:1, 2.0 # univisium
# 70mm, 2.2
# 21:9, 21/9 # cinematic wide screen
# Œ¥, 2.414 # silver ratio
# UPV70, 2.76 # ultra panavision 70
# 32:9, 32/9 # ultra wide screen
# PV, 4.0 # polyvision
```

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and are not read by the extension. To use a custom value, simply uncomment the respective line by removing the `#` at the beginning. A custom aspect ratio is defined as `button-label, aspect-ratio-value # comment`. You can choose any label for the button. It's recommended to set the `aspect-ratio-value` as a fraction, but integers or floats work as well. The `# comment` is optional.

Resolution presets can be defined in the `resolutions.txt` file:

```
1, 512, 512 # 1:1 square
2, 768, 512 # 3:2 landscape
3, 403, 716 # 9:16 portrait 
```

Use the format `button-label, width, height, # optional comment`. Again, lines starting with `#` are ignored.

## Calculator Panel

The calculator allows you to determine new width or height values based on the aspect ratio of source dimensions. Here's how it works:

- Click `Calc` to show or hide the aspect ratio calculator.
- Set the source dimensions:
  - Enter them manually.
  - Click ‚¨áÔ∏è to get source dimensions from txt2img/img2img sliders.
  - Click üñºÔ∏è to get source dimensions from the input image component on the current tab.
- Click ‚áÖ to swap the width and height if needed.
- Specify the desired width or height and click either `Calculate Height` or `Calculate Width` to compute the missing value.
- Click `Apply` to transfer the values to the txt2txt/img2img sliders.
